# Consistent

This repository is my attempt in [100 commits competition](https://100commitow.pl/).

## Project

My initial plan is to create tool/system that will allow you to write comments and notes in your project.
The catchy part is to keep them in separate file but display in the one with code.

---

## Demo

I need to record the example of usage.

## How to install

Not installable yet.

## How to use

Describe options of `bip`

## Problems

- When you use `join` command you can apply comments more than once

## Future plans

## TODO

- [ ] Make it pip installable
- [ ] Fix double join
- [ ] Show abandoned comments
- [ ] Show deleted comments
